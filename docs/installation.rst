Installation
============

To install the **latest release**, run this command in your terminal::

    pip install -U cloup

Cloup adheres to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

.. warning::
    Since Cloup has not reached v1.0, its API is not to be considered stable.
    This doesn't mean you can't already use it: it is already tested and usable.
    Just make sure you specify a version constraint in your list of
    requirements, e.g.::

        cloup==0.3.*
